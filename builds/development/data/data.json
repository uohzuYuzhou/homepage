        "introduction" : "<p>This course provides the core knowledge to begin programming in any language. Simon Allardice uses JavaScript to explore the core syntax of a programming language, and shows how to write and execute your first application and understand what's going on under the hood. The course covers creating small programs to explore conditions, loops, variables, and expressions; working with different kinds of data and seeing how they affect memory; writing modular code; and how to debug, all using different approaches to constructing software applications.</p><p>Finally, the course compares how code is written in several different languages, the libraries and frameworks that have grown around them, and the reasons to choose each one.</p>",

        "introduction" : "<p>Do you want to become a web developer? Nowadays, web development isn't one job. There is a range of technologies and career options to explore. The core responsibilities are split two ways—between front-end developers who specialize in websites and applications and back-end developers who work with servers and databases—but you can also become a full-stack developer who oversees all aspects of a project. This course provides an overview of the different jobs available in web development, the tools and frameworks to focus on, and the skills each job entails. Senior staff author Ray Villalobos also provides tips on finding training, getting hired, and maximizing your earning potential in this lucrative and exciting field.</p>",

        "introduction" : "<p>CSS is a stylesheet language that allows you to control the appearance of your webpages. In this hands-on course—the first installment in an ongoing series—Christina Truong demonstrates the concepts that form the foundation of CSS, and explains how to use this language to add colors and other design elements to take your webpages beyond just black text on a white background. Christina covers selecting content, how the box model defines the spacing and sizing of page elements, styling text, and managing basic layouts. She also explores the tools needed to work with CSS, how to use selectors to target elements, and guidelines for page layouts with floats. Plus, at the end of the course, you'll walk away with an actual project—an online résumé page.</p>",

Once seen as optional, JavaScript is now becoming an integral part of the web, infusing every layer with its script.</p><p>Through practical examples and mini-projects, this course helps you build your understanding of JavaScript piece by piece, from core principles like variables, data types, conditionals, and functions through advanced topics including loops, closures, and DOM scripting. Along the way, you will also be introduced to some ES6 and the basics of JavaScript libraries.</p>",
